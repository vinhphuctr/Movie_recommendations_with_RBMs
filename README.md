# Movie_recommendations_with_RBMs

In this project, I will use one of the Deep Learning networks - the Restricted Boltzmann Machine model - to recommend movies based on datasets of 100,000 ratings applied to more than 9,000 movies by over 600 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. 

The datasets are created by [Grouplens](https://grouplens.org/), a research group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Minnesota. Last updated 9/2018. The zip file (**small version**) can be downloaded [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).

As these datasets will change over time, I fix my current applied analysis: **Movie recommendations on July 10, 2019.**
